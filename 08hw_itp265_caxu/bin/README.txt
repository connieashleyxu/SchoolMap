1. How did this assignment affect your comfort level with using classes inheritance and polymorphism? What remaining questions or concerns do you have about these topics? How do you plan on getting those questions answered or addressed?
Practicing with inheritance and polymorphism in homework helps me with making me work out points of confusion. In the beginning, I felt nervous about starting the homework because I wasn't sure if I fully understood the depth of inheritance -- but, hashing out problems in the code helped with understanding connections. I do not have any questions at the moment, but will be sure to reach out if anything arises.

2. Which method(s) was/were most complicated for you to test usage of and **why**?
The methods utilizing the HashMaps were the most difficult for me just because I tried to parse through the documentation for HashMaps, but then just got too bogged down in the details.

3. Which method(s) was/were easy for you to test usage of and **why**?
The imported files had pre-built methods which I thought were easier (even just being able to understand the code). It could be because they were already built out, so it was easier to decipher the meaningof them.

4. After playing with these methods in HashMap, are there questions you have about any of them and when or why you would use them?
Not at the moment; but if any arise, I'll be sure to reach out!

5. Are there general questions you have about Maps?
Not at the moment; but if any arise, I'll be sure to reach out!
